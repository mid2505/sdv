1.Define data visualization and explain it's role in decision making process in modern data driven environments. support your explanation with real-world examlples.

2.Describe the different stages of the visualization pipeline. Illustrate each stage with a specific example(eg. health care, sales data, climate data)

3.Explain Gibson's affordance theory.How is this theory relevant in the context of designing effective visual interfaces on dashboard?

4. Analyze the costs(Time, resources and misinterpretation) and benifits(clarity, insights, communication) of using data visualization. Provide an example where the cost of visualization was justified by the outcome.

5. List and explain the different types of data and analyse it by using any of the sample dataset.

6. What are Ipython magic commands? Differentiate between line magics. write the example of each and explain their functionality using simple python code.

7. Discuss how Ipython trails input and output history. How can a user access previously executed command and their results?

8. When use the common types of errors encountered in Ipython? How does Ipython help in landing or displaying error better than the default python interpreter.

9. write the program script in ipython that deliberately raises and exception(division by zero) and demonstrate how to control and manage the exception using try,except and else.

10. what are %time,%timeit and %     used in ipython? compare there use for      and timing python code.include sample code to measure the execution time of a function.
